This year too, the growing \\nimportance of climate risk was emphasised in ING’s first integrated climate report. \\n \\nProtecting our bank and our customers also means continuously improving our risk culture and \\nbehaviours. Everyone at ING has a responsibility to understand, discuss and act on the many non-\\nfinancial risks that banks are confronted with every day. To this end, we introduced a risk culture \\nprogramme in 2021 that aims to ensure our risk culture reflects the dynamic business and regulatory \\nenvironment we operate in. By acting with the right mindset and living up to our Orange Code and \\nGlobal Code of Conduct, we all play a part in safeguarding ING and our customers.', 'Contents \\nIntroduction \\nReport of Management Board \\nRisk management \\n \\nCorporate governance \\nConsolidated financial statements \\n \\nParent company financial statements \\nOther information', '> Our strategy', 'ING Bank Annual Report 2021 \\n9', 'Knowing our customers (KYC) and ensuring we only do business with people and companies that meet \\nregulatory requirements and are within our risk appetite, are essential for preventing financial \\neconomic crime.

We also assess the environmental \\nand social impact of companies and projects we finance.  \\n \\nSince 2017, we’ve introduced a number of structural improvements to enhance our KYC organisation \\nand activities, including standardised policies and digital tooling, and further increasing knowledge and \\nawareness across the bank. This includes mandatory e-learnings for all staff and the KYC and Risk \\nAcademies for more specialist training. We are building on this with our financial economic crime \\ncontrols maturity programme, which consolidates all our activities to fight financial economic crime \\n(policies, systems and processes) in one holistic approach.   \\n \\nWith the growing number of digital transactions and employees working from home it’s of the utmost \\nimportance to safeguard ING and our customers against cybercrimes such as digital fraud, phishing \\nscams and malicious software.

We \\nconsider people’s expectations about how their data is used and respect their privacy when processing \\nit. Local and global data ethics councils help ensure we use data responsibly.', 'Healthy business', 'While the economy picked up in many of our markets in 2021, to remain a financially healthy business \\nit’s imperative that we diversify our income, optimise capital allocation and scrutinise costs. Our 2021 \\nfigures show we’re on the right track, with fee income up 17% compared to a year earlier and \\ncontributing 19% to our full-year income, which is a crucial component of our strategy to diversify our \\nrevenue sources in the negative interest environment. This strong fee income growth combined with \\nhigher lending volumes contributed to a 4.8% increase in total income compared to 2020, while net \\ncustomer deposits grew with €10.3 billion.  \\n \\nWe earned higher fees from daily banking activities in 2021, spurred by economic recovery, and \\nbenefitted from continued demand for digital investment products in our Retail business. Our results \\nwere also supported by low risk costs. We were able to release some of the Covid-19-related provisions \\nwe took earlier and are confident about the quality of our loan book. However, we remain cautious \\nabout the impact of supply chain disruptions, rising energy prices and increasing inflation on \\ncompanies and consumers. We therefore remain ready to support our clients when they need it.  \\n \\nEnsuring ING remains a financially healthy company means there are also times we have to make \\ndifficult decisions about where and how we allocate our capital, so that we put it to work in the places \\nthat provide the best growth opportunities and viable returns. Unfortunately, this can affect our \\ncustomers and colleagues. In the current environment, with varying local and regulatory \\nenvironments, we believe that we require sufficient local scale in the Retail markets in which we \\noperate to maintain a reasonable franchise. It’s in these markets that we want to invest our people, \\ncapital and costs. This led to our decision to exit selected Retail markets in 2021. Separately, we \\ndecided to wind down our payment services provider Payvision, which we believe was not evolving \\nrapidly enough to keep pace with the competitive payments market, and to stop certain partnerships. \\nThese include discontinuing the consumer-facing smart money app Yolt to focus instead on growing its \\nbusiness-to-business open banking platform Yolt Technology Services. We also sold our stake in Dutch \\nproperty platform Makelaarsland as the partnership did not bring what we had expected from it.', 'Contents \\nIntroduction \\nReport of Management Board \\nRisk management \\n \\nCorporate governance \\nConsolidated financial statements \\n \\nParent company financial statements \\nOther information', '> Our strategy', 'ING Bank Annual Report 2021 \\n10', 'We had expenses under control in 2021, with room for us as a digital-first bank to improve our cost-to-\\nserve, supported by investments in further (end-to-end) digitalisation. This brings benefits to the \\nexperience of customers and colleagues and improves our operational quality and processing speed. It \\nalso helps us better absorb the eroding effects of negative interest rates on our net interest income.  \\n \\nData-driven digitalisation', 'Delivering on our customer promise is all about creating a customer experience that’s personal, easy \\nand smart. And a key driver for this is digitalisation – a trend that was accelerated by the Covid-19 \\npandemic and the demand it unleashed for mobile and contactless banking – and data, which is the \\nfuel powering end-to-end digitalisation.  \\n \\nReflecting the growing importance of technology and digitalisation in fulfilling our purpose and \\nstrategy, in 2021, ING appointed a chief technology officer to its Management Board Banking for the \\nfirst time, having split the role of the chief operations officer. Digitalisation has benefits for our \\ncustomers, our employees and our business. Automating tasks frees up time for more rewarding \\nactivities. It improves efficiency and effectiveness, and helps to make our bank safer and compliant-by-\\ndesign. However, we also have to be cognisant of those customers who are not (yet) fully digital and \\nensure our products and services remain accessible to them. \\n \\nIn 2021, mobile interactions grew to 6.2 billion from 5.3 billion in 2020, accounting for 91% of total \\ninteractions with ING. The number of mobile payment transactions also grew each quarter, with 267 \\nmillion made in 4Q 2021, compared to 154 million transactions in 1Q 2020.  \\n \\nThis digital connectivity in turn yields data and insights that contribute to a more personalised and \\nempowering experience, giving customers even more reason to interact with us. This is how we believe \\nwe can become an essential part of people’s digital lives. \\n \\nMastering data is essential for this. Data, used responsibly, helps us understand our customers better \\nand personalise our interactions. It is the main ingredient for the models that inform our business \\ndecisions, manage risks and keep our capital in control. We use transaction data to detect money \\nlaundering and fight financial crime. And it powers technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics and \\nblockchain that digitalise processes and improve the customer experience. Examples include using', 'machine learning to understand why customers contact us and proactively come up with solutions \\nthat will reduce the number of calls in future; virtual assistants to help customers 24/7; and instant \\nloans, personalised insurance and easy-to-use investment products. And there are innovative solutions \\nfor ING and for our customers, such as Komgo, which digitalises trade finance; supply chain \\nmanagement tool Stemly; and Flowcast to reduce risk and unlock credit for businesses.  \\n \\nTo make raw data meaningful it needs to be sorted, harmonised and put into context. That’s why it’s \\nessential to have one common language for defining our data. We call this ING Esperanto. In addition, \\nwe’re standardising data models (Esperanto Warehouse Model) through which we can store and use \\nour data. This approach contributes to the availability, quality, integrity, usability, control and \\ngovernance of our data. We also have a uniform global customer data management approach that \\nfacilitates customer self-service and enables new ways of doing banking by making it easier to retrieve \\ninformation that can be used to propose new types of billable ING services or new product bundles. \\nGlobal and local data ethics councils guide our decisions around the use of data based on ING’s Orange \\nCode values.   \\n \\nOur customers’ appreciation of ING’s smart and personal experience is reflected in above-average NPS \\nscores in a number of our Retail and Wholesale Banking markets. Over the past year we gained \\n481,000 primary customers, bringing the total to 14.3 million, 3.5% higher than at end-2020.  \\n \\nING is not the only bank with digital ambitions. Society’s growing reliance on the internet has \\nfundamentally changed the way people shop – and pay. These changing behaviours, along with the \\nsecond European Payments Services Directive (PSD2), are reshaping the role of banks in the payments \\nindustry, opening it up to new (non-traditional) payments providers. To stay a step ahead in this \\ncompetitive digital environment, there’s a growing urgency to speed up end-to-end digitalisation and \\nthe associated requirement for operational excellence.  \\n \\nGiven the increasing commoditisation of payments and the need for scale and efficiency to remain \\ncompetitive in this fast-growing area, we’re looking to create a dedicated payments and settlement \\nutility within the chief technology office domain in 2022 that will deliver all payments, settlement and \\nliquidity services across ING, subject to Works Council approval. Until now this has been done within the \\nbusiness lines, notably Wholesale Banking, also for Retail payments. The aim is to build on our existing']\n",

      "['Customers trust us with their money and their data, and this is a responsibility we take very seriously.  \\nSafeguarding customer data and data privacy are growing in importance on the global agenda across \\nsectors and geographies. This is required by an increasing legislative focus, for example through the \\nEU’s second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) around data sharing and the General Data Protection \\nRegulation (GDPR), with which we align our own global data protection policy.  \\n \\nData controllers or processors who want to transfer personal data outside of the European Economic \\nArea (EEA) must ensure that the data subject is granted a level of protection equivalent to that \\nguaranteed by GDPR. In 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union introduced the Schrems II \\nruling, confirming that European companies have to carry out individual assessments of each data \\ntransfer to a non-EEA country. In 2021, the European Commission also introduced new standard \\ncontractual clauses to the GDPR governing the transfer of data to third countries such as the US. \\nFollowing the Schrems II ruling, ING launched its own transfer impact assessments and the necessary \\nupdates of our standard contractual clauses, all of which should be completed by year-end 2022.  \\n \\nFinancial institutions need to walk the fine line between privacy protection and fostering data sharing; \\nagain, countries differ in their approach. At EU level there is a clear regulatory trend towards more \\ndata portability and more data sharing. Under the Digital Markets Act, Big Techs will be required to \\nfacilitate data portability and we expect the future Open Finance proposal to establish PSD2-like data \\nportability.', 'Culture and ethics', 'Trust is integral to our role as a bank.

We encourage employees to speak up \\nwhen they are confronted with unethical or illegal behaviour and provide a variety of reporting \\nchannels, including via their manager, local compliance officer or an ING whistleblower reporting \\nofficer.

We have a digital, mobile-first mindset and \\nwe’ve put in place the building blocks for becoming a data-driven digital bank.

This year too, the growing \\nimportance of climate risk was emphasised in ING’s first integrated climate report. \\n \\nProtecting our bank and our customers also means continuously improving our risk culture and \\nbehaviours. Everyone at ING has a responsibility to understand, discuss and act on the many non-\\nfinancial risks that banks are confronted with every day. To this end, we introduced a risk culture \\nprogramme in 2021 that aims to ensure our risk culture reflects the dynamic business and regulatory \\nenvironment we operate in.

We also focus strongly on \\nmanaging our exposure to operational risks with respect to the availability of our networks and \\ninfrastructure to ensure we’re always accessible to our customers and our employees.  \\n \\nClosely related to cybersecurity resilience is protecting customers’ data and their privacy. To this end, \\nING follows European data protection regulation (GDPR) and local laws applicable in our countries.

Our 2021 \\nfigures show we’re on the right track, with fee income up 17% compared to a year earlier and \\ncontributing 19% to our full-year income, which is a crucial component of our strategy to diversify our \\nrevenue sources in the negative interest environment. This strong fee income growth combined with \\nhigher lending volumes contributed to a 4.8% increase in total income compared to 2020, while net \\ncustomer deposits grew with €10.3 billion.  \\n \\nWe earned higher fees from daily banking activities in 2021, spurred by economic recovery, and \\nbenefitted from continued demand for digital investment products in our Retail business. Our results \\nwere also supported by low risk costs. We were able to release some of the Covid-19-related provisions \\nwe took earlier and are confident about the quality of our loan book. However, we remain cautious \\nabout the impact of supply chain disruptions, rising energy prices and increasing inflation on \\ncompanies and consumers. We therefore remain ready to support our clients when they need it.  \\n \\nEnsuring ING remains a financially healthy company means there are also times we have to make \\ndifficult decisions about where and how we allocate our capital, so that we put it to work in the places \\nthat provide the best growth opportunities and viable returns. Unfortunately, this can affect our \\ncustomers and colleagues. In the current environment, with varying local and regulatory \\nenvironments, we believe that we require sufficient local scale in the Retail markets in which we \\noperate to maintain a reasonable franchise. It’s in these markets that we want to invest our people, \\ncapital and costs. This led to our decision to exit selected Retail markets in 2021. Separately, we \\ndecided to wind down our payment services provider Payvision, which we believe was not evolving \\nrapidly enough to keep pace with the competitive payments market, and to stop certain partnerships. \\nThese include discontinuing the consumer-facing smart money app Yolt to focus instead on growing its \\nbusiness-to-business open banking platform Yolt Technology Services. We also sold our stake in Dutch \\nproperty platform Makelaarsland as the partnership did not bring what we had expected from it.', 'We had expenses under control in 2021, with room for us as a digital-first bank to improve our cost-to-\\nserve, supported by investments in further (end-to-end) digitalisation.

However, we also have to be cognisant of those customers who are not (yet) fully digital and \\nensure our products and services remain accessible to them. \\n \\nIn 2021, mobile interactions grew to 6.2 billion from 5.3 billion in 2020, accounting for 91% of total \\ninteractions with ING. The number of mobile payment transactions also grew each quarter, with 267 \\nmillion made in 4Q 2021, compared to 154 million transactions in 1Q 2020.  \\n \\nThis digital connectivity in turn yields data and insights that contribute to a more personalised and \\nempowering experience, giving customers even more reason to interact with us. This is how we believe \\nwe can become an essential part of people’s digital lives. \\n \\nMastering data is essential for this. Data, used responsibly, helps us understand our customers better \\nand personalise our interactions. It is the main ingredient for the models that inform our business \\ndecisions, manage risks and keep our capital in control.

And there are innovative solutions \\nfor ING and for our customers, such as Komgo, which digitalises trade finance; supply chain \\nmanagement tool Stemly; and Flowcast to reduce risk and unlock credit for businesses.  \\n \\nTo make raw data meaningful it needs to be sorted, harmonised and put into context. That’s why it’s \\nessential to have one common language for defining our data. We call this ING Esperanto. In addition, \\nwe’re standardising data models (Esperanto Warehouse Model) through which we can store and use \\nour data. This approach contributes to the availability, quality, integrity, usability, control and \\ngovernance of our data. We also have a uniform global customer data management approach that \\nfacilitates customer self-service and enables new ways of doing banking by making it easier to retrieve \\ninformation that can be used to propose new types of billable ING services or new product bundles. \\nGlobal and local data ethics councils guide our decisions around the use of data based on ING’s Orange \\nCode values.   \\n \\nOur customers’ appreciation of ING’s smart and personal experience is reflected in above-average NPS \\nscores in a number of our Retail and Wholesale Banking markets.

Society’s growing reliance on the internet has \\nfundamentally changed the way people shop – and pay. These changing behaviours, along with the \\nsecond European Payments Services Directive (PSD2), are reshaping the role of banks in the payments \\nindustry, opening it up to new (non-traditional) payments providers. To stay a step ahead in this \\ncompetitive digital environment, there’s a growing urgency to speed up end-to-end digitalisation and \\nthe associated requirement for operational excellence.  \\n \\nGiven the increasing commoditisation of payments and the need for scale and efficiency to remain \\ncompetitive in this fast-growing area, we’re looking to create a dedicated payments and settlement \\nutility within the chief technology office domain in 2022 that will deliver all payments, settlement and \\nliquidity services across ING, subject to Works Council approval.

Adherence with these tolerances is monitored and reported in accordance with internal procedures.', 'Risk assessment \\nThe Group´s standard approach to risk assessment of its non-financial risks and controls is in line with industry standards and comprises the \\nfollowing steps: scoping, risk identification, inherent risk assessment, control identification and assessment, residual risk assessment, and \\nmitigation actions/issues management. The Group also conducts scenario analyses to understand exposure to low-frequency high-severity \\nevents. Results from risk assessments and stress tests are used as input for the Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).', 'Event management \\nEvent management aims to ensure timely and appropriate handling of detected events in order to minimise the impact on the Group and its \\nstakeholders, as well as to prevent reoccurrence.
